## Indoor Navigation App for Blind Users
The goal of the project is to develop a lidar-based iPhone app that assists blind individuals in navigating indoor environments. The app should provide real-time information about obstacles, potential hazards, and the general layout of the surroundings.

## In the Future
We will add documentation for APIâ€™s, SDK, and any additional installations necessary to run the application. This includes usage examples, request/response formats, and dependencies required. Additionally, a user manual will be provided in order to aid the user when navigating through our application.
